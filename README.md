## Description

The Directus App is a Vue.js powered SPA designed to work with the Directus API to let the user manage all the data in the connected project. It's the GUI of working with the data in a Directus installation. 

## Installation / Usage

**NOTE:** When using Directus, the admin app is included out of the box. You only have to install the app separately if you want to contribute to the project.

1. Clone the repo
2. Install the depencencies using `npm` / `yarn`
3. Run `npm run build` to compile the app to a production bundle.

## Development

You can run the application standalone using the included dev server. Run `npm run dev` in your terminal to fire up the Directus App with Hot Module Reloading and the Vue Devtools integration enabled.

By default, the application will connect to the demo API (https://demo.directus.io) when running in development mode. To connect to your own local API, provide the URL in the `API_URL` environment variable:

```
API_URL=http://localhost:8888 npm run dev
```
